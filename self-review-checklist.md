# Self-review checklist

You should always review your own extension first. Please make sure:

- [ ] repository has the topic `datenstrom-yellow`, [see documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics)
- [ ] repository has the license `GPL version 2`, [see license file](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow/blob/main/LICENSE.md)
- [ ] check that the extension works with a brand new installation
- [ ] check for consistency, apply the same patterns and standards at all times
- [ ] check for code security and adherence to our coding standard
- [ ] check for spelling errors and adherence to our documentation standard
- [ ] don't keep code parts that are leftovers from experimentation
- [ ] don't have features just in case someone needs them later
- [ ] don't have code comments inside methods and functions
- [ ] don't have more than one extension per repository
- [ ] don't have failing tests in a pull request
