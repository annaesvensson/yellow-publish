# Self-review checklist

You should always review your own extension first. Please make sure:

- [ ] you have increased the version number in your source code before publishing
- [ ] you checked for code security and adherence to our coding standard
- [ ] you checked for spelling errors and adherence to our documentation standard
- [ ] you checked your extension settings and repository settings have the same `Description`
- [ ] you checked your extension settings use either `Status: experimental` or `Status: available`
- [ ] you checked your repository has the annotated [license file](https://github.com/annaesvensson/yellow-publish/blob/main/LICENSE.md) and [gitattributes file](https://github.com/annaesvensson/yellow-publish/blob/main/.gitattributes)
- [ ] don't keep features/settings/files that are leftovers from experimentation
- [ ] don't have features/settings/files just in case someone needs them later
- [ ] don't have code comments inside methods and functions
- [ ] don't have more than one extension per repository
