# Self-review checklist

You should always review your own extension first. Please make sure:

- [ ] you have increased the version number in your source code
- [ ] you have set `Status: available` in your [extension settings](https://github.com/annaesvensson/yellow-publish#settings)
- [ ] you checked for code security and adherence to our coding standard
- [ ] you checked for spelling errors and adherence to our documentation standard
- [ ] repository has the same description as your extension settings
- [ ] repository has the topic `datenstrom-yellow`, [see documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics)
- [ ] repository has the default branch `main`, [see documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-branches-in-your-repository/changing-the-default-branch)
- [ ] repository has the annotated `GPL version 2`, [see license file](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow/blob/main/LICENSE.md)
- [ ] don't keep features/settings/files that are leftovers from experimentation
- [ ] don't have features/settings/files just in case someone needs them later
- [ ] don't have code comments inside methods and functions
- [ ] don't have more than one extension per repository
