# Self-review checklist

You should always review your own extensions first. Please make sure:

- [ ] repository has the topic `datenstrom-yellow`
- [ ] repository has our GPLv2 license file
- [ ] check that extension works with a brand new installation
- [ ] check for code security and adherence to our coding standards
- [ ] check for spelling errors and adherence to our documentation standards
- [ ] check for consistency, apply the same patterns and standards at all times
- [ ] do not have code comments inside methods and functions, communicate exceptions
- [ ] do not have more than one extension per repository, communicate exceptions
- [ ] do not have features in case someone needs them later, communicate exceptions
- [ ] do not focus on technical details, but on people and their everyday life

Our coding standard uses few comments, mainly for:

- file header and legal stuff, as little as necessary
- class methods and functions, one comment line before
- class instance variables, one comment at the end of the line
- TODOs, for example things that need fixing in a later release

Our documentation standard uses one extension per repository, mainly to:

- explore/filter all extensions at https://github.com/topics/datenstrom-yellow
- know what extensions someone has work on recently, GitHub profiles list them
- hand over extensions between developers/designers, GitHub has an automatic redirect
- understand which extensions are experimental, for example with the topic `experimental`
