# Self-review checklist

You should always review your own extension first:

- [ ] You checked that everything works as expected in a [brand new installation](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow).
- [ ] You checked that extension settings and repository settings have the same `Description`.
- [ ] You checked that extension settings use either `Status: experimental` or `Status: available`.
- [ ] You checked that the repository has the topic `datenstrom-yellow`.
- [ ] You checked that the repository follows the [style guide](https://github.com/annaesvensson/yellow-help/blob/main/style-guide.md).
- [ ] Don't keep features/settings/files that are leftovers from experimentation.
- [ ] Don't have features/settings/files just in case someone needs them later.
- [ ] Don't have code comments inside methods and functions.
- [ ] Don't use the words "easy, flexible, user-friendly".
- [ ] Don't have more than one extension per repository.
