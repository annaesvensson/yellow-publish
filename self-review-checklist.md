# Self-review checklist

You should always review your own extension first:

- [ ] You checked that everything works as expected in a [brand new installation](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow).
- [ ] You checked that your repository has the topic `datenstrom-yellow`.
- [ ] You checked that your extension settings use either `Status: experimental` or `Status: available`.
- [ ] You checked that your extension settings and repository settings have the same `Description`.
- [ ] You checked that your extension follows the [style guide](style-guide.md) to a reasonable extend.
- [ ] Don't keep features/settings/files that are leftovers from experimentation.
- [ ] Don't have features/settings/files just in case someone needs them later.
- [ ] Don't have code comments inside methods and functions.
- [ ] Don't use the words "easy, fast, user-friendly".
- [ ] Don't have more than one extension per repository.
