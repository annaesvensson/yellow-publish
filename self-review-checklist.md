# Self-review checklist

You should always review your own extension first. Please make sure:

- [ ] you checked that everything works as expected in a brand new installation 
- [ ] you checked that extension settings and repository settings have the same `Description`
- [ ] you checked that extension settings use either `Status: experimental` or `Status: available`
- [ ] you checked that repository has the topic `datenstrom-yellow`
- [ ] you checked that repository has the annotated [license file](https://github.com/annaesvensson/yellow-publish/blob/main/LICENSE.md) and [gitattributes file](https://github.com/annaesvensson/yellow-publish/blob/main/.gitattributes)
- [ ] you checked that repository follows our [style guide](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow/blob/main/STYLEGUIDE.md)
- [ ] don't keep features/settings/files that are leftovers from experimentation
- [ ] don't have features/settings/files just in case someone needs them later
- [ ] don't have code comments inside methods and functions
- [ ] don't have more than one extension per repository
